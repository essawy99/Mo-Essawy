                <h1> About</h1>
                <p> I am a student at the University of Minnesota with a passion for technology. Naturally, this interest
                  drew me to software because of the rapid improvement in the field and the impact it has on our world.
                  I'm also fascinated by the design of complex systems which makes programming very attractive to me
                  because it allows me to express my ideas through the creation of  these systems.

                <h1> Education</h1>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a Inter-disciplinary degree
                  from the University of Minnesota in Computer Science 
                  and biology where I am fullfilling all of the core.
                  Computer Science courses. Once I complete my degree, 
                  I will transfer to a Computer Science program and 
                  complete electives. To give an understanding of the
                  Computer Science courses that entail this type of degree
                  I have outlined below the Computer Science courses in the
                  program. Currently I have a Cumalative GPA of 3.65. My 
                  junior/senior year GPA is 3.88, and my Computer Science
                  GPA is a 4.0.

                <h2 class = projectSubheader> Description</h2>
                <p id="b"> I worked with a team of two other people to build a game
                  using javascript. We did not rely on any game engines but we did use a library 
                  called paper.js that allowed us to avoid accessing javascript directly to produce
                  shapes and rely on a couple built in functions to focus our efforts on the actual
                  game logic.
                </p>
                <h2 class = projectSubheader> Motivation </h2>
                <img id = firstProgram src = "firstProgram.png"></img>
                <p id="b"> One of the first programs I ever wrote was a brickbreaker game. It was very
                rudimentary in the way it was architected and fell apart quickly. However, I'm still 
                nostalgic towards it because it showed me what
                was possible with even a very basic understanding of programming and built my love
                for software that led to me switching my career path. Inspired by it, 
                I recruited a couple of people to build a much larger and more complex version of 
                the game using my newfound programming skills I've been building in my courses. 
                The finished product was a game called shipbreaker. 
                </p>
                
                <h2 class = projectSubheader> How To Access it </h2>
                <p id="b"> The codebase is available here, and a website dedicated to the game is here.
                  Otherwise acroll down to play the game. Click through the Instructions to get an ideas
                  of how the game works. If you want more screen space to play the game press 
                  shift-command-f on mac to hide the top of your browser and refresh or play the game on 
                  the actual website to avoid the website header. As you restart your browser the game builds
                  based off the width and height of the canvas element its contained in.
                </p>
                
                <h2 class = projectSubheader> Issues </h2>
                <p>There is some sort of memory leak associated with paper.js that results in a gradual slowdown
                  of the program as more objects are created. If you take snapshots of the heap as the program
                  runs you can see it grow despite objects being removed from the project. Unfortunately, this problem 
                  is in the library and cannot be fixed on my end. However, as a next step, I plan to start digging 
                  into paper.js andsee if it can be fixed. Then, I can send a pull request and hopefully have 
                  the problem fixed for everybody as I have seen a number of complaints on the web. The issue
                  is not extreme and for the most part it is not noticable if you have a higher-end machine.
                  Development of the game had to be cut short as the new semester started and teamates no longer
                  wanted to continue to build the game. I did what I could to complete the game but there were a 
                  few bugs that crept into the final build, and a few features that had to be removed from the game 
                  before completion. Still, I accomplished what I wanted through building the game which was to
                  see what happens when developing a relatively large program with a number of people, have a 
                  chance to be creative and build something cool outside of the constraints of a school setting,
                  and pay respects to my first ever program using my new programming skills. </p>

                  <p>While designing our project we found that it was very tedious to design objects using paper.js 
          in a text editor. 
          It involved a lot of guess and check and I wanted to automate that process. So I volunteered 
          to design a program that allows you to draw objects with your cursor and print out a class  
          that allows you to place that object on your codebase. With helper functions that allow you 
          to move and remove that object. It also comes with a save key that allows you to reload and 
          edit that object at a later time. I would’ve liked to add more features, but I decided its 
          best to keep it relatively simple so that I could continue building the actual game. 
        The UI isn't very easy to use but was built to only be used in house. However, Inbedded it here
        so you can use it to get an understanding of how it works. The codebase is here in the Creator file
        Click to add points to create a shape. You can any drag points around but remember that clicking
        on a different shape selects it and any new points or features added are inserted to that shape
        Use the toolbar on the left to add another shape or add features to your current shape. It takes
      some time to get used to but it is much easier to use than paper.js in a text editor. </p>
