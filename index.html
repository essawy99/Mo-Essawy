      <h1> About</h1>
      <p> I've always had a deep interest in the science and technology that has enabled the progress 
          we've made as humans. When I entered college, I decided to pursue this interest
          by studying Biology. Around the end of my junior year, I began to program in my free time. 
          I am fascinated by the design of complex systems
          and programming allows me to express my ideas through the creation of these systems. 
          I decided to switch to an Inter-Disciplinary degree in Biology and 
          Computer Science to explore programming further. As I went on in my studies, I realized  
          that Computer Science is geared towards problem-solving, while Biology
          focused more on brute memorization. Careers in software entailed creative engineering, while
          the careers in Biology followed strict protocols. Further, the progress in Biology
          is slow while computer technology is progressing at an incredible speed
          disrupting nearly every industry, something I wanted to be a part of. 
          As I fell in love with software, I decided to get a full degree in Computer Science
          and pursue a career in software engineering. As I'm progressing in my study of Computer Science I am incredibly
          grateful that I made that choice and am excited to learn more and gain more experiences in software
          engineering.

      <h1> Education</h1>
      <p>I am currently pursuing a Inter-Disciplinary degree
          in Computer Science and Biology at the University of Minnesota.
          I am taking all of the core Computer Science courses, then 
          I will transfer to a Computer Science program and 
          complete the electives. To give an understanding of the
          Computer Science courses that entail this type of degree,
          I have outlined below the Computer Science courses in the
          program. Currently, I have a Cumulative GPA of 3.65. My 
          junior/senior year GPA is 3.88, and my Computer Science
          GPA is a 4.0.

      <h1> Project</h1>
      <h2 class = projectSubheader> Motivation </h2>
      <img id = firstProgram src = "firstProgram.png"></img>
      <p id="b"> One of the first programs I ever wrote was a brickbreaker game. You can see 
        a screenshot of it to the left. It had a very rudimentary architecture and fell apart quickly. 
        However, I'm still nostalgic towards it because it showed me what
        was possible with even a very basic understanding of programming. It also built my love
        for software that motivated me to switch my career path. Inspired by it, 
        I recruited a couple of people to build a much larger and more complex version of 
        the game using the newfound programming skills I've been building in my courses. 
      
      <h2 class = projectSubheader> Description</h2>
      <p id="b"> I worked with a team of two other people to build the game using javascript. 
        I made a plan and roadmap and divided out work among teammates. We held regular 
        meetings where I would come up with revisions to our plans based on our current
        progress and issues. I would help teammates when they had trouble figuring out what to do, 
        share my screen to help debug code, and explain algorithms that need to be implemented.
        We ran into multiple roadblocks and fundamental issues, but it
        was still a valuable experience in working on a codebase with a team simultaneously and scaling
        it up to build more functionality.
        We did not rely on any game engines but we did use a library 
        called paper.js that allowed us to avoid accessing javascript directly to produce
        shapes and rely on a couple built in functions to focus our efforts on the actual
        game logic.
      </p>
      
      <h2 class = projectSubheader> How To Access it </h2>
      <p id="b"> The finished product is shipbreaker. The codebase is available 
        <a href="https://github.com/essawy99/game.github.io">here,</a>  and a website 
        dedicated to the game is <a href="https://essawy99.github.io/game.github.io/">here.</a> 
        Otherwise scroll down to play the game. The iframe element I used to embed the project
        can be a little buggy so I
        recommend accessing it through the website. Click through the Instructions to get an idea
        of how to play. 
      </p>
                
      <h2 class = projectSubheader> Issues </h2>
      <p>There is some sort of memory leak associated with paper.js that results in a gradual slowdown
        of the program as more objects are created. It seems that paper.js holds all created objects 
        in a data structure that is never cleaned out. This data structure is likely iterated through when
        drawing objects on the screen. Thus, if you take snapshots of the heap as the program
        runs, you can see it grow despite objects being removed from the project. Unfortunately, this problem 
        is in the library and cannot be fixed on my end. However, as a next step, I plan to start digging 
        into paper.js and see if it can be fixed. Then, I can send a pull request and hopefully have 
        the problem fixed for everybody as I have seen a number of complaints on the web. The issue
        is not extreme and the game is still enjoyable if you have a higher-end machine. Refreshing the 
        browser frees the memory and raises performance again.
        Further, development of the game had to be cut short as the new semester started and teammates no longer
        wanted to continue to build the game. I did what I could to complete the game, but there were a 
        few bugs that crept into the final build, and a few features that had to be removed from the game 
        before completion. Still, I accomplished what I wanted through building the game which was to
        see what happens when developing a relatively large program with a number of people, have a 
        chance to be creative and build something cool outside of the constraints of a school setting,
        and pay respects to my first ever program using my new programming skills. </p>

        <h2 class = projectSubheader> Helper Application </h2>
        <p>While designing our project we found that it was very tedious to design objects using paper.js 
          in a text editor. 
          It involved a lot of guess and check and I wanted to automate that process. So I volunteered 
          to design a program that allows you to draw objects with your cursor and print out a class  
          that that can be inserted into the codebase. The class contains helper functions that allow you 
          to move and remove the object. It also comes with a save key that allows you to reload and 
          edit the drawing at a later time. I would’ve liked to add more features, but I decided its 
          best to keep it relatively simple so that I could continue building the actual game. 
          The UI isn't very easy to use but it was built to only be used in house. The codebase is 
          <a href="https://github.com/essawy99/Creator">here </a> and you can access the application 
          <a href="https://essawy99.github.io/Creator/">here. </a> 
          I embedded the Application
          below, but I would recommend accessing it directly through the webpage
          because iframe is very buggy. 
          Click to add points to create a shape. You can drag any point around but remember that clicking
          on a different shape selects it and any new points or features added are inserted to that shape.
          Use the toolbar on the left to add another shape or add features to your current shape. It takes
          some time to get used to but it is much easier to use than paper.js in a text editor. </p>
